# Bixby Projects
## List of my bixby projects

I dont really know how to use GitHub to make different repositories within repositories so I'l just be Linking all my projects here with a small description.

- ### [Hello World Project](https://github.com/akshat9000/Hello-World-bixby)
  This is the most basic Bixby project you can create. In it, Bixby essentially repeats what you say, and I've modified it a bit to append a *"NOT!"* at the end of each sentence,   so in a way, it is an angry parrot project.

- ### [Dice Roll Project](www.google.com)
  This is another very simple project with step by step instructions given by Bixby at their [developers' page](https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/sample-capsules). The original   example given at their page allows the user to input the *number of dice* to be rolled and the *number of sides* each die should have. The output then is the digits that the       dies turn up and their sum. In my implementation, I have removed the option of inputting the number of dice and their sides, and instead restricted it to 2 dice with 6 sides       each, so all you have to do is give any one of the commands *Roll, Roll Dice, Drop, Drop Dice*. Also I have added a feature of detecting *Snake-Eyes*, which is basically when     both the dice turn up *'1'*, so it kind of looks like snake's eyes, and its also a common gambler's lingo.

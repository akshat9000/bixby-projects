## List of my bixby projects

I dont really know how to use GitHub to make different repositories within repositories so I'l just be Linking all my projects here with a small description.

  <summary>Hello World Project</summary>
  <h3>Hello World</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/akshat9000/Hello-World-bixby">Hello World</a> is the most basic Bixby project you can create. In it, Bixby essentially repeats what you say, and I've modified it a bit to append a <i>"NOT!"</i> at the end of each sentence,   so in a way, it is an angry parrot project.

  <summary>Dice Roll Project</summary>
  <h3>Dice Roll</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/akshat9000/Bixby-Dice-Roll">Dice Roll</a> is another very simple project with step by step instructions given by Bixby at their <a href="https://bixbydevelopers.com/dev/docs/sample-capsules">developer's page</a>. The original example given at their page allows the user to input the <i>number of dice</i> to be rolled and the <i>number of sides</i> each die should have. The output then is the digits that the dies turn up and their sum. In my implementation, I have removed the option of inputting the number of dice and their sides, and instead restricted it to 2 dice with 6 sides each, so all you have to do is give any one of the commands <i>Roll, Roll Dice, Drop, Drop Dice.</i> Also I have added a feature of detecting <i>Snake-Eyes</i>, which is basically when both the dice turn up <i>'1'</i>, so it kind of looks like snake's eyes, and its also a common gambler's lingo.
